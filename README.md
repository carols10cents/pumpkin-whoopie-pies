**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You are only allowed to make these between Oct 1 and Dec 31 of each year. Otherwise you are eating LAST YEAR'S PUMPKIN and furthering the PUMPKIN CREEP.

## Cookies

* 1 smallish pie pumpkin, you want about 1 1/2 c + 1/2 c (separated) pumpkin after roasting
* 1 c vegetable oil

* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon

### Instructions

1. Roast the pumpkin (this can be done the day before, needs cooling time):
  * Preheat oven to 350°F.
  * Cut pumpkin in half and scoop out seeds and gunk. Rinse and roast the seeds if you'd like!
  * Place the pumpkin halves cut side down on a pan.
  * Roast until the insides are tender when poked with a fork, depends on the size of the pumpkin. At least 30 min.
  * Remove from oven and allow to cool until you can handle them.
  * Scoop out of shell with a spoon. Set aside 1/2 c for the filling.
2. Lightly grease baking sheets.
3. Combine oil and brown sugar. 
4. Mix in 1 1/2 c pumpkin and eggs, beat well.
5. Add flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and mix well.
6. Drop by heaping teaspoons onto sheets.
7. Bake at 350°F for 10-12 min.
8. Let cool before making sandwiches out of two cookies and filling.

## Filling

### Ingredients

* 8 oz cream cheese at room temperature
* 1 c unsalted butter at room temperature
* 1 c confectioners sugar
* 1/2 c pumpkin reserved from before
* pinch of cinnamon to taste
* pinch of nutmeg to taste

### Instructions

1. With a paddle attachment on your mixer, whip together cream cheese, butter, and confectioners sugar on medium until smooth, about 3 minutes.
2. Add pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg; whip until smooth, scraping down the bowl as necessary.

I recommend keeping the sandwiches in the fridge and separating layers with parchment paper; they can get gooey and sticky!
